># Day 2: May 22, 2020

    <h3>## Today's Progress: </h3>
    * Introduction to Express
    * Route Parameters
    * Introduction to Templating Engines with EJS 
        * View Engine
        * Rendering 
        * Passing of data

    * dotenv library to store secret keys
    * Finish a ToDo-list application using nodejs

    ## Notes
    * Express default views directory should be views. To use another directory instead of the default use express.set('views', __dirname + '/directory name').

    * to use a static file location, app.use('route', express.static('folder_name'))
    with this, we can apply css to our html files. By convention, this folder will be called "Public"

    * body-parser middleware is now built into express

    * When pushing information to git, make sure all sensitive information such as password are in .gitignore file.

    ## Challenges

    * Unable to call a delete method from a form, but found a way to use a get request to perform delete operations [not sure if this is the right way]
